# Git-GitHub-Crash-Course
ðŸš© Following along with video tutorial content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&amp;t=1556s

## Follow along actions: 
- Edited readme for Update README.md commit.
- Opened folder in VS, and cloned repo using GitBash Terminal.
- Detour: SSH key is needed earlier than in the video. Deleted repo, used other resources to set up SSH Key, and re-cloned the repo.
- Create new index.html file, modified this readme. 
- Practiced git commands:  `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "comment" -m "description"`, and `git push origin main`.
- Created a new repo locally, connected to a new repo on GitHub using `git remote add orgin *link*`
- Practiced adding a branch in GitBash, viewing the branches, and using `git checkout [filename]` to navigate between branches.
- Used GitHub to create a pull request for new branch, and needed to use editor to resolve conflicts between branches. Need more practice on committing regularly.
- Delete branch, merged master to a branch, handled merge conflict (muttered in confusion).
- Practiced undoing staging and commits in a variety of ways. 

## Points of confusion & future learning:
- Pull requests on projects with many working on one repo - how is it all coordinated?
- How often are commits made - every edit?
- How often do you sync your branch?
- Git commands versus VS code or GitHub interface (what should I become accustomed to?)
- What do you house on GitHub? Would you store website build files in a repo?
- What are ways to practice GitHub in a fun way?
- How to get involved with open source?
